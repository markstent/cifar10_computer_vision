# Tensorflow Cifar dataset image classification

This was a project for one of the modules on my masters degree. The Cifar dataset is a classic academic set to work on for image classification.

Jupyter notebook can be found [here](/CETM26_Assignment_2_CODE.ipynb)

## Technologies/Libraries used

- Tensorflow
- Keras
- Sklearn
- Seaborn
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
## Results

I was able to test various Keras modules and tune hyperparameters in CNN models and data augmentation and transfer learning. I managed to get around 88 percent accuracy just by optimizing number of layers, max pooling and batch normalisation.
## What I learned

Training computer vision models takes time and resources! Initially I used the GPU on my Mac M1 but found it to be too slow, so I moved the trianing process to Google Colab and paid for some extra GPU power, and even then it took hours!

I also learned that sometimes the simple models work better and overcomplicating things does just that.
